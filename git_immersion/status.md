* Learn how to check the status of the repository

## Check the status of the repository

Use the `git status` command to check the current status of the
repository.

`git status`{{execute}}

The status command reports that there is nothing to commit.  This
means that the repository has all the current state of the working
directory.  There are no outstanding changes to record.

We will use the `git status` command to continue to monitor the
state between the repository and the working directory.
