## Goals

* To setup git and ruby so that it is ready for work.

## Setup Name and Email

Before we begin, you need to do some setup first.
Run the following commands so that `git` knows your name and email.  HINT:
You can click on a command to copy it to the clipboard and then paste it
into the terminal window.

`git config --global user.name "Your Name"`{{copy}}
`git config --global user.email "your_email@whatever.com"`{{copy}}



## Setup Line Ending Preferences

Run the following commands so that `git` has proper line ending settings.  
HINT: These commands are linked so that if you click them the command will
be executed in the terminal automatically.

`git config --global core.autocrlf input`{{execute}}
`git config --global core.safecrlf true`{{execute}}
