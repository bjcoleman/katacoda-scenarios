## Setup Name and Email

Before we begin, you need to do some setup first.
Run the following commands so that `git` knows your name and email.

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@whatever.com"
```

And run the following commands so that `git` has proper line ending settings.

```
git config --global core.autocrlf input
git config --global core.safecrlf true
```
