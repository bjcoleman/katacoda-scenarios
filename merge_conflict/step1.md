## Setup

In this scenario, you are automatically set up so that `git`
commits as a user named "Katacoda Scenario" with an email
address of "scenario@katacoda.com."  This means that your
commits will appear under the "Katacoda Scenario" on Github.

If you would prefer to have commits save using your name
and email address, you can edit the `.gitconfig`{{open}}.
